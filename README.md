# To setup your Pico

You need to have git installed. Make sure that you have python installed and that is in the path. You can verify this in terminal
by running <kbd>python --version</kbd> or <kbd>python3 --version</kbd>. If you see python version then python is in the path.

You also need to have mpremote installed. To install mpremote:

- <kbd>pip install mpremote</kbd>
  
  or
  
- <kbd>python -m pip install mpremote</kbd>
